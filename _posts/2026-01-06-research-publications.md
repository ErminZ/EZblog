# My Research Publications

This page catalogs my research contributions across food science, microbiology, immunology, and biotechnology.

## Peer-Reviewed Journal Articles

**2022**
- **Microbial enzymes induce colitis by reactivating triclosan in the mouse gastrointestinal tract.** *Nature Communications* 13, 136 (2022). [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27762-y](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27762-y)
