# Welcome to EZblog ðŸ§¬ðŸ¤–  
*AI + Bioinformatics Notes from the Field*

Hi â€” Iâ€™m **Ermin Zhao**, a computational biologist exploring how AI and machine learning can unlock insights in genomics and biomedical data.

**EZblog** is where I share hands-on notes, workflows, and reflections from my work â€” including:

- ðŸ”¬ Bioinformatics pipelines (e.g., single-cell, VCF, 10X)
- ðŸ¤– ML tools and models applied to biology
- ðŸ§° Technical tips (Python, Nextflow, Docker, AWS)
- ðŸ““ Project logs, failures, and lessons learned

This space is both a lab notebook and a way to give back to the community. If you're building at the edge of biology and computation, I hope youâ€™ll find something useful here.

Thanks for visiting!  
**â€“ Ermin**
